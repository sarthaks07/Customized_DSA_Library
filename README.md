# 📚 Customized DSA Library

This is a custom-built Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) library implemented in C. It contains reusable, modular, and easy-to-understand functions for commonly used data structures such as Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Custom implementations of major data structures
- 🔁 Reusable and modular functions
- 📦 Header-file based organization for easy integration
- 🧪 Sample programs and test cases for each module
- 💡 Helpful comments and clean code structure

## 🧱 Implemented Data Structures

- **Singly Linked List**
  - Insert at beginning, end, position
  - Delete node
  - Display list
  - Count nodes
  - Reverse list

- **Doubly Linked List**
  - All basic operations with two-way traversal

- **Stack**
  - Using arrays
  - Using linked list

- **Queue**
  - Linear queue using array
  - Circular queue
  - Queue using linked list

- **Additional Utilities**
  - Reversal functions
